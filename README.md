### Project Description

#### Data
The data layer is the outermost layer of the application and is responsible for communicating with the server-side or a local database and data management logic. It also contains repository implementations.

##### 1. Data Source

Describes the process of acquiring and updating the data.
Consist of remote and local Data Sources. Remote Data Source will perform HTTP requests on the API. At the same time, local Data sources will cache or persist data.
##### 2. Models

An entity will depend on the data acquired from the different data sources.
Serialization of JSON structure into Dart maps Entity objects to Models and vice-versa.
##### 3. Repository

The bridge between the Data layer and the Domain layer.
Actual implementations of the repositories in the Domain layer. Repositories are responsible for coordinating data from the different Data Sources.

<b> But in this project the Domain Layer wasn't use because it could make the project look cumbersome <b>

#### Presentation
The presentation layer is the most framework-dependent layer. It is responsible for all the UI and handling the events in the UI. It does not contain any business logic.

##### a. Widget (Screens/Views)

Widgets notify the events and listen to the states emitted from the Bloc.
##### b. BloC

Receive the events from the views and interact with use cases accordingly.
Emit the state according to the data received from the use cases.
Bloc does not know about the view at all. It communicates in the form of states and events only.

## Folder Structure

<b>The main purpose for this approach is the sole reason of acheiving true seperation of concern
e.g in this project the presentation folder or the UI doesn't have any knowledge of the backend or the state of the data coming from firebase instead it only communicates to the controller to show the different state of the data <b>

### Local Setup

- Create a firebase account if not already
- Create a new project in your firebase
- Go to settings and add android to your project
- You have the option of using flutter fire cli or u can download the google-services.json after configuring your platform configurations
- Create a firebase account if not already
- Go to settings and add android to your project.
- Remember the package name you give to your application.
- Download the ```google-services.json``` and place it in ```android/app``` folder.
- Now, in ```android/app/build.gradle``` file change line 37 to your own applicationId which you gave in step 5 above.
- Alternatively you can use the ```FlutterFire Cli``` to automatically configure this settings and file addition. You can check out the FlutterFire CLI on how to install and use it 
- In firebase, enable the ```Firestore Database```, and ```Authentication``` services. In the Authentication service make sure to add Email-Password and Google Auth providers for sign-in and sign-up features to work.
- Run ```flutter pub get```.
- Run ```flutter run``` to run the app in your android emulator/device.
